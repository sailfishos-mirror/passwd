0.79:
* Dropped the rpm spec file.  Conceptually it belongs in distributions,
  and two-way synchronization between fedorahosted and Fedora pkgs repository
  doesn't really make sense.
* Updated man page, notably adding long option formats.
* Updated translations.
* Very minor bug fixes.
* Build system and warning cleanups.
* libuser >= 0.58 is now required.
